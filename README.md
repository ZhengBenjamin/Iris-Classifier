# Iris-Classifier
Implements a single-layer neural network to classify the Iris dataset into two classes based on petal dimensions. It learns decision boundaries through gradient descent and visualizes its performance over time with metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and decision boundaries plotted on the data.
